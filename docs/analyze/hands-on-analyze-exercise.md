# 🏋️ Flutter Analyze Hands-On Exercise

## Before You Start
This exercise uses your BDD Gherkin project to learn Flutter Analyze through practice.

---

## Exercise 1: Your First Analysis Run

### Step 1: Check Your Starting Point
```bash
# Open terminal in your project folder
cd /home/io/StudioProjects/bdd_gherkin

# Run your first analysis
flutter analyze
```

**📝 Write down your results:**
- Number of issues found: ____
- Most common issue type: ________________
- Severity levels seen: ________________

**🎉 Good news:** Your current result should be "No issues found!" because we just fixed everything!

### Step 2: Understand Your Configuration
```bash
# Look at your analysis rules
cat analysis_options.yaml | head -20
```

**🔍 Exploration tasks:**
1. How many rule categories do you see? ____
2. Which rules are marked as "error" level? ________________
3. What does `include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` do? ________________

---

## Exercise 2: Intentionally Breaking Things (Learning from Mistakes)

### Step 3: Create Analyzer Issues
Let's intentionally introduce some issues to learn how to fix them:

**Create a test file with problems:**
```bash
# Create a file with intentional issues
cat > lib/bad_example.dart << 'EOF'
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;  // Unused import

class myBadWidget extends StatelessWidget {  // Bad naming
  myBadWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);  // Constructor naming
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    String name;  // Uninitialized variable
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Bad Example")),  // Should use single quotes
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Text("Hello"),          // Should be const
            Text(name.toString()),  // Using uninitialized variable
            RaisedButton(           // Deprecated widget
              onPressed: () {},
              child: Text("Click me"),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
EOF
```

### Step 4: Run Analysis and Count Issues
```bash
flutter analyze
```

**📊 Count the issues:**
- Errors: ____
- Warnings: ____
- Info/Lints: ____
- Total issues: ____

**🔍 Most common issue type:** ________________

---

## Exercise 3: Fixing Issues One by One

### Step 5: Fix Import Issues
Look at the analyzer output and find the unused import issue.

**🎯 Your task:** Remove the unused import from `lib/bad_example.dart`

**Before fixing, predict:** How many issues will this fix? ____

**After fixing:**
```bash
flutter analyze
```
**Actual result:** Fixed ____ issues

### Step 6: Fix Naming Issues
Find the class naming issue (should be PascalCase).

**🎯 Your task:** Fix the class name and constructor name

**Questions to think about:**
1. What should `myBadWidget` become? ________________
2. What should the constructor name become? ________________

**Fix it and test:**
```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Step 7: Fix Quote Consistency
Find the quote style issues.

**🎯 Your task:** Change double quotes to single quotes where suggested

**Pro tip:** You can use this command to help:
```bash
# Find all double quotes in your file
grep '"' lib/bad_example.dart
```

### Step 8: Fix Performance Issues
Find the `const` constructor suggestions.

**🎯 Your task:** Add `const` keywords where the analyzer suggests

**Learning question:** Why does `const` improve performance?
_Your answer:_ ________________________________________________

### Step 9: Fix Deprecated Widgets
Find the deprecated widget warning.

**🎯 Your task:** Replace `RaisedButton` with `ElevatedButton`

**Before and after comparison:**
```dart
// Before:
RaisedButton(onPressed: () {}, child: Text('Click me'))

// After:
// Your solution here
```

## Exercise 4: Using Auto-Fix Magic

### Step 10: Let Dart Fix Things Automatically
```bash
# Try the auto-fix command
dart fix --apply
```

**📈 Results:**
- Issues before auto-fix: ____
- Issues after auto-fix: ____
- Issues fixed automatically: ____

### Step 11: What Can't Be Auto-Fixed?
```bash
flutter analyze
```

**🤔 Remaining issues:**
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________

**💡 Why can't these be auto-fixed?**
_Your analysis:_ ________________________________________________

---

## Exercise 5: Understanding Severity Levels

### Step 12: Create Different Severity Examples
Add these to your `lib/bad_example.dart`:

```dart
// Add at the top of the file
import 'dart:io';  // Will be unused - creates INFO

// Add inside the build method
void problematicMethod() {
  var x;  // Uninitialized - creates WARNING
  print(x.toString());  // Using uninitialized - creates ERROR
}
```

### Step 13: Analyze Severity Impact
```bash
flutter analyze
```

**🚦 Categorize each issue by severity:**

**🔴 Errors (code won't work):**
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

**🟡 Warnings (might cause problems):**
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

**🔵 Info/Lints (style issues):**
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

---

## Exercise 6: Customizing Rules

### Step 14: Disable a Rule Temporarily
Sometimes you need to ignore a specific rule. Edit your `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
linter:
  rules:
    # Disable single quotes rule temporarily
    prefer_single_quotes: false
```

**Test the change:**
```bash
flutter analyze
```

**📊 Result:** 
- Issues before disabling rule: ____
- Issues after disabling rule: ____
- Which issues disappeared? ________________

### Step 15: Re-enable the Rule
Change `prefer_single_quotes: false` back to `prefer_single_quotes: true`

**🎯 Question:** Which approach is better for team projects - strict rules or flexible rules?
_Your opinion:_ ________________________________________________

---

## Exercise 7: IDE Integration Practice

### Step 16: Explore IDE Features
Open `lib/bad_example.dart` in your IDE (VS Code or Android Studio).

**🔍 Visual inspection:**
1. Count red squiggly lines: ____
2. Count yellow squiggly lines: ____
3. Count blue squiggly lines: ____

### Step 17: Use Quick Fixes
1. Click on a line with a squiggly underline
2. Look for a light bulb icon 💡 or "Quick Fix" option
3. Try applying a quick fix

**📝 Document your experience:**
- Which issue did you fix? ________________
- How many clicks did it take? ____
- Did it fix correctly? Yes/No: ____

---

## Exercise 8: Real-World Scenarios

### Step 18: Clean Up Your Test File
Your goal: Get `lib/bad_example.dart` to zero analyzer issues.

**Strategy checklist:**
- [ ] Fix all naming issues
- [ ] Remove unused imports
- [ ] Add const keywords where suggested
- [ ] Replace deprecated widgets
- [ ] Fix quote consistency
- [ ] Handle uninitialized variables safely

**Final check:**
```bash
flutter analyze
```

**🎉 Success criteria:** "No issues found!"

### Step 19: Delete the Test File
Once you've learned from it:
```bash
rm lib/bad_example.dart
flutter analyze  # Should be clean again
```

## Exercise 9: Team Workflow Simulation

### Step 20: Simulate Pre-Commit Workflow
Create this workflow script:

```bash
cat > scripts/pre-commit-check.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Running pre-commit analysis..."

# Format code
echo "📝 Formatting code..."
dart format lib/ test/

# Fix auto-fixable issues
echo "🔧 Auto-fixing issues..."
dart fix --apply

# Final analysis
echo "🧐 Final analysis..."
flutter analyze

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ All checks passed! Ready to commit."
else
  echo "❌ Issues found. Please fix before committing."
  exit 1
fi
EOF

chmod +x scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
```

**Test your workflow:**
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
```

**📊 Workflow results:**
- Formatting changes: Yes/No ____
- Auto-fixes applied: Yes/No ____
- Final analysis result: ________________

---

## Exercise 10: Advanced Analysis

### Step 21: Analyze Different File Types
```bash
# Analyze just Dart files in lib/
flutter analyze lib/

# Analyze just test files
flutter analyze test/

# Analyze a specific file
flutter analyze lib/main.dart
```

**🔍 Compare results:**
- Lib issues: ____
- Test issues: ____
- Main.dart issues: ____

### Step 22: Machine-Readable Output
```bash
# Get JSON output for scripting
flutter analyze --machine > analysis_results.json

# Look at the structure
cat analysis_results.json | head -5
```

**💻 Use case:** When might you want machine-readable output?
_Your answer:_ ________________________________________________
